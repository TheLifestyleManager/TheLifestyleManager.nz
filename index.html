        <h2>About Josh</h2>

        <p class="about-intro">
          I’m Josh — the person people call when life gets complicated. 
          I help high-performing humans, elders, and busy households simplify their world, 
          solve problems, and free up time/energy for the things that actually matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          My friends and clients often describe me as “the ultimate life hack.” 
          Not because I do everything for them — but because I help them focus on what they 
          truly care about while I handle the things they don’t have time, patience, or bandwidth for.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work with a calm, grounded presence and a fast, precise way of getting things done. 
          I listen deeply, sense the real need beneath the surface, and translate that into clear 
          actions, solutions, and outcomes. Whether it’s tech, travel, logistics, home projects, 
          personal admin, or bringing a creative idea to life — I’m there to make things easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve helped entrepreneurs streamline their entire week, elders feel safe and confident 
          online, and busy families regain time they thought they’d lost for good. 
          I become a trusted extension of your life — the steady support that keeps things moving 
          without friction.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the heart of what I do is a simple intention: 
          to help you live more of the life you’ve worked so hard to build.

          A few common questions about how The Lifestyle Manager works.

            <summary>Who is The Lifestyle Manager for?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                I work best with people who have plenty of responsibility and limited bandwidth:
                high performers, business owners, elders who feel out of their depth with technology,
                busy parents, and households with a lot of moving parts.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've reached the point where doing everything yourself is costing you time,
                energy or peace of mind, this service is likely a good fit.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>Do you work in-person, online, or both?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Both. I'm based in Ōtautahi / Christchurch and can work in-person locally, 
                as well as online with clients across Aotearoa and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many things can be handled remotely (research, tech support, planning, admin),
                and for certain clients or projects we can arrange in-person visits or travel as needed.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What are your hours and availability?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                My availability is flexible and depends on the client and the arrangement we create.
                For ongoing support, we'll agree on clear windows where you can expect fast responses,
                and when I'm offline.
              </p>
              <p>
                I put my phone on airplane mode at night, but outside of that, I'm generally responsive
                and present. We'll set expectations together so you know exactly what to count on.
              </p>

          <details class="faq-item">

              <p>
                I don't do cleaning or heavy physical labour. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My focus is on problem solving, logistics, tech, planning, research, coordination,
                and being a calm, capable extra mind and pair of hands in your life.
                If something sits outside my scope, I'll help you find the right person for it.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>How does pricing work?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                For one-off jobs, I usually quote a simple hourly or fixed fee once I understand the scope.
                For ongoing support, we can choose a monthly package that matches the level of involvement you need.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see example packages and pricing on the

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Book a free 20-minute call</strong> to explore whether we're a good fit, or
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Send a one-off job by email</strong> if you already know exactly what you need.

              </ul>
              <p>

          If you&#39;re feeling the pull to simplify your life, we can start small and clear:
          a short conversation, or a one-off job to see how it feels to work together.
        </p>

        <div class="contact-layout">
          <div class="contact-option">
            <h3>Not sure yet? Let&#39;s talk.</h3>
            <p>
              A short call or video chat is often the easiest way to sense whether this is the right fit.
              We&#39;ll look at where life feels heavy, what you&#39;d love support with,
              and what working together could look like.
            </p>
            <p><strong>You might reflect on:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What feels most overwhelming or energy-draining right now?</li>
              <li>What would you love to hand over to someone you trust?</li>
              <li>If life felt 30% lighter, what would change first?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When you&#39;re ready, use the button below and let me know whether you prefer
              a phone call or video call, plus a few times that work for you.

              If you have a clear one-off job — like researching the best TV, changing internet providers,
              planning a trip, or handling a specific piece of admin — you can email me the details directly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>It helps if you include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What you want done (e.g. “help me choose and buy a new TV”)</li>
              <li>Any constraints (budget, timing, brands you like or dislike)</li>
              <li>Where you&#39;re currently stuck or frustrated</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I&#39;ll reply with a clear next step, an estimated timeframe, and a one-off fee for the job.
