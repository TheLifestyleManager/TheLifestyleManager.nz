              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p class="about-intro">
                I’m Josh — the person people call when life feels full, complicated, or stuck. I help busy and
                high-performing people untangle their world, solve problems, and create more space for what actually
                matters.
              </p>
            </div>

            <p>
              I’m often described as the person who brings clarity and momentum back into their life. Not because I
              take over everything, but because I help people stay focused on what they care about while I handle the
              tasks they don’t have time or energy for.
            </p>

            <p>
              I work with a calm, grounded presence and a fast, intuitive way of getting things done. I’m good at
              understanding what a situation might need and translating that into clear actions, solutions, and next
              steps. Whether it’s tech, travel, logistics, admin, or bringing an idea to life, I take the pressure off
              so life moves again.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve helped entrepreneurs streamline their weeks, households regain breathing room, and clients of all
              ages feel confident navigating technology and modern systems. Over time, I become a trusted extension of
              their life — the steady, reliable support that keeps things flowing without friction.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the core of my work is a simple intention:
              to give you more space for what actually matters.

            <summary>Who do I work best with?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                I work best with people who have plenty of responsibility and limited bandwidth:
                high performers, business owners, elders who feel out of their depth with technology,
                busy parents, and households with a lot of moving parts.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you've reached the point where doing everything yourself is costing you time,
                energy or peace of mind, this service is likely a good fit.

            <summary>Do you work in-person, online, or both?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Both. I'm based in Ōtautahi / Christchurch and can work in-person locally, 
                as well as online with clients across Aotearoa and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many things can be handled remotely (research, tech support, planning, admin),
                and for certain clients or projects we can arrange in-person visits or travel as needed.

          <details class="faq-item">
            <summary>What are your hours and availability?</summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                My availability is flexible and depends on the client and the arrangement we create.
                For ongoing support, we'll agree on clear windows where you can expect fast responses,
                and when I'm offline.
              </p>
              <p>
                I put my phone on airplane mode at night, but outside of that, I'm generally responsive
                and present. We'll set expectations together so you know exactly what to count on.

                My focus is on problem solving, logistics, tech, planning, research, coordination,
                and being a calm, capable extra mind and pair of hands in your life.
                If something sits outside my scope, I'll help you find the right person for it.

                For one-off jobs, I usually quote a simple hourly or fixed fee once I understand the scope.
                For ongoing support, we can choose a monthly package that matches the level of involvement you need.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see example packages and pricing on the 
                <a href="services.html">Services &amp; packages</a> page. 
                We can always adjust the details after an initial conversation.

          If you&#39;re feeling the pull to simplify your life, we can start small and clear:
          a short conversation, or a one-off job to see how it feels to work together.
        </p>

        <div class="contact-layout">

            <h3>Not sure yet? Let&#39;s talk.</h3>
            <p>
              A short call or video chat is often the easiest way to sense whether this is the right fit.
              We&#39;ll look at where life feels heavy, what you&#39;d love support with,
              and what working together could look like.
            </p>
            <p><strong>You might reflect on:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What feels most overwhelming or energy-draining right now?</li>
              <li>What would you love to hand over to someone you trust?</li>
              <li>If life felt 30% lighter, what would change first?</li>
            </ul>

              a phone call or video call, plus a few times that work for you.

              If you have a clear one-off job — whether it’s sorting out a piece of tech, planning travel, researching
              a purchase, coordinating something at home, or dealing with a task you’ve been avoiding — you can email
              me the details directly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>It helps if you include:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>What you want done</li>
              <li>Any constraints (budget, timing, preferences)</li>
              <li>Where you&#39;re currently stuck or overwhelmed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I&#39;ll reply with a clear next step, an estimated timeframe, and a one-off fee for the job.
