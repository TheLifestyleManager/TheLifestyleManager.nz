            <p>
              I’m often described as the person who brings clarity and momentum back into their life.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s not because I take over everything; I help people stay focused on what they care about while I
              handle the tasks they don’t have time or energy for.
            </p>

            <p>
              I work with a calm, grounded presence and a fast, intuitive way of getting things done. I’m good at
              understanding what a situation might need and translating that into clear actions, solutions, and next
              steps.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether it’s tech, travel, logistics, admin, or bringing an idea to life, I take the pressure off so life
              moves again.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’ve helped entrepreneurs streamline their weeks, households regain breathing room, and clients of all
              ages feel confident navigating technology and modern systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over time, I become a trusted extension of their life — the steady, reliable support that keeps things
              flowing without friction.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the core of my work is a simple intention:
              to give you more space for what actually matters.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                I work best with people who have plenty of responsibility and limited bandwidth:
                high performers, business owners, elders who feel out of their depth with technology,
                busy parents, and households with a lot of moving parts.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                Both. I'm based in Ōtautahi / Christchurch and can work in-person locally, 
                as well as online with clients across Aotearoa and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many things can be handled remotely (research, tech support, planning, admin),
                and for certain clients or projects we can arrange in-person visits or travel as needed.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                My availability is flexible and depends on the client and the arrangement we create.
                For ongoing support, we'll agree on clear windows where you can expect fast responses,
                and when I'm offline.
              </p>
              <p>
                I put my phone on airplane mode at night, but outside of that, I'm generally responsive
                and present. We'll set expectations together so you know exactly what to count on.

              <p>
                I don't do cleaning or heavy physical labour.

              <p>
                My focus is on problem solving, logistics, tech, planning, research, coordination,
                and being a calm, capable extra mind and pair of hands in your life.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>
                For one-off jobs, I usually quote a simple hourly or fixed fee once I understand the scope.
                For ongoing support, we can choose a monthly package that matches the level of involvement you need.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can see example packages and pricing on the

                <p>
                  Josh came into my life and helped me clean up, organise, and structure everything with precision. His knowledge
                  of technology and systems made my whole world feel more streamlined and smooth to run.
                </p>

                <p>
                  He supported me to sort out a lot in my business, cleaned up my digital systems, and taught me how to use and
                  optimise AI in ways that genuinely improved my workflow. He also helped me reach the right audiences and finally
                  tick off the little tasks I kept avoiding and the things that sit on the to-do list forever! Having Josh’s
                  support to get them done has freed me up to focus on the parts of my business I love.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Josh brings positivity, calmness, and a clear sense of what needs to happen to bring everything into harmony. He
                  explains things in a way that makes the complicated feel simple, and his honesty and depth of knowledge have been
                  such a gift. My life feels more refined and organised because of his support.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thank you, Josh. I highly recommend this wonderful man and his services.

                  Josh&#39;s help in finding a new phone made the experience so much easier. I shared the things that mattered most to
                  me, and he took it on from there. Researching options, sending me his thoughts, and sharing short video reviews to
                  help me understand each choice.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What I appreciate most is that he genuinely enjoys doing this. Something that usually feels overwhelming and
                  time-consuming for me comes naturally to him, and his enthusiasm makes the whole process lighter, easier, and
                  even fun. It felt like a potentially stressful task was turned into a supported and enjoyable experience. I deeply
                  value the care and clarity I received through the process. I couldn’t have asked for better guidance.
