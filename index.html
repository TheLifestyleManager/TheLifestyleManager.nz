        <h2>About Josh</h2>

        <p class="about-intro">
          I’m Josh — the person people call when life gets complicated. 
          I help high-performing humans, elders, and busy households simplify their world, 
          solve problems, and free up time/energy for the things that actually matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          My friends and clients often describe me as “the ultimate life hack.” 
          Not because I do everything for them — but because I help them focus on what they 
          truly care about while I handle the things they don’t have time, patience, or bandwidth for.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work with a calm, grounded presence and a fast, precise way of getting things done. 
          I listen deeply, sense the real need beneath the surface, and translate that into clear 
          actions, solutions, and outcomes. Whether it’s tech, travel, logistics, home projects, 
          personal admin, or bringing a creative idea to life — I’m there to make things easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve helped entrepreneurs streamline their entire week, elders feel safe and confident 
          online, and busy families regain time they thought they’d lost for good. 
          I become a trusted extension of your life — the steady support that keeps things moving 
          without friction.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the heart of what I do is a simple intention: 
          to help you live more of the life you’ve worked so hard to build.
